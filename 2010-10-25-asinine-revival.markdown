Well, the site's gone dead over the last few months, but that's going to change.

Regular updates, news stories, and opinions from the staff will be featured, and discussed in the forums. Members can participate in the discussions, and offer their own opinions and maybe experiences on a topic. We look forward to this!

Both staticsafe and I have been incredibly busy (and most likely will continue to be, for some time) but we'll do our best to bring you the best tech community there is.

See you around!
