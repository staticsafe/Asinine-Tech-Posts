My interest in Banshee was sparked by a [OMG! Ubuntu! article](http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/12/help-improving-banshees-performance-on-maverick/) on improving Banshee's performance. So I decided to install Banshee (look for it in your distro's package management system).

Just a note - before I installed Banshee, I upgrade the SQLite package to 3.7.4 as suggested by the article. This fixes the bug that used to slow down Banshee ([Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/sqlite3/+bug/688781))

I started Banshee, and it asked me if I wanted to import my music from Rhythmbox or add my library folder. I opted to import my library from Rhythmbox and it did the job beautifully!

Supposedly, one of the things that were fixed with the SQLite update was the search functionality. I would agree.

Here's a video showing the fast search functionality (watch in HD and full screen for optimal viewing experience):



Now to move on to the rest of the program.

**Interface**

By default, Banshee starts with the music browser mode:

Also, as you can see from the screenshot, the left sidebar has some cool functionality. For example the sidebar has some built-in playlists like Favorites, Unheard music etc. These come real handy when you are bored and want to surprise yourself to music you have never listened to in your library or if you just want to listen to your favorites.

Now Playing screen:

Really really cool.




Mini-mode




This is one of the extensions, that come with Banshee. It is really nice minimalistic mode of Banshee, that only shows the song that is currently playing and player controls.

**Plugins/Extensions**

Banshee has a variety of extensions which make your musical life so much better. It has the obligatory [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/user/staticsafe) extension, which is a tad better than the one that Rhythmbox uses as this doesn't require you to enter your Last.fm credentials in Banshee itself but opens up the Last.fm page where you authorize the application.

Screenshot of the Last.fm extension in action:

[caption id="attachment_315" align="aligncenter" width="300" caption="Lastfm Extension in Banshee"][![](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bansheelastfm-300x187.png)](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/bansheelastfm.png)[/caption]

This page takes a little while to load, in fact I would say this is the slowest part of Banshee. It's most probably due to the fact that it's pulling the data from Last.fm servers.

Other cool extensions:



	
  * Apple device support

	
  * Last.fm Radio

	
  * Podcasts

	
  * Amazon MP3 import

	
  * Audiobooks library

	
  * Fix Music Metadata (really really cool, finds duplicate albums, artists and fixes them for you)

	
  * Ubuntu One integration

	
  * LIRC support


**Other cool features/news**



	
  * Dock integration - Banshee plays well with popular docks like Docky and AWN (not tested with AWN).

	
  * [Covergloobus support](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/covergloobus.png)

	
  * Full integration with Ubuntu


Banshee is going to be the default music player in Ubuntu 11.04 (Natty Narwhal) replacing long-time favorite Rhythmbox. You can expect full integration with the Ubuntu desktop then. 

As pointed out by TechnoticRaccoon, there IS integration with Ubuntu, this is an extension that exists in the package called banshee-community-extensions.

I really should use Synaptic more. :P

**Overall conclusion**

Banshee is a very good piece of software that does it's job at managing your music library. It is also very fast, and has very useful extensions that enhances your interaction with your music.

What do you think? Do you currently use Banshee? Have you used it previously? What are your thoughts on it becoming the default in Natty Narwhal?

Discuss.

P.S - Feel free to point out spelling and grammatical errors.
