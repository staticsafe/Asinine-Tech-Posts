"Ikatako is a virus that spreads through Japanese P2P network Winny, aided by the pirates' lack of wit. Once downloaded and run, the virus sends their data to a central server and replaces it with cephalopod and cnidarian imagery. Japanese hacker (and virus creator) Masato Nakatsuji thought he wouldn't be arrested this time. However, Japanese police considered the files in Japanese pirates' hard drives to be more important than his manga depictions of octopods and other tentacled fauna."

I always knew there was something funny about P2P networks, and there's the proof: a Japanese virus that changes pirated software and other media into pictures of "octopods and other tentacled fauna".

I wonder how much the collective amount of media the pirates had? And had this hacker done the world of copyrights and legalities a favour?
