Gnome 3.0 is the next major release of the gnome desktop environment. This release has had controversy following it around since the beginning because of the radical new UI changes it brings. Dumping the old panels in favor of a new shell that takes advantage of modern hardware to provideÂ a computing experience on par with the well known proprietary operating systems. For the purposes of this review I was using a fresh install of Arch Linux on an Acer Aspire One netbook, 1.6Ghz Intel Atom N455, 1GB of DDR3 RAM, and integrated Intel GMA.


## Look & Feel


First, let's talk about the new gnome-shell since it is the most obvious change in this release. The new shell is largely written in javascript and features an _app centric _design that aims to help you be more productive. The emphasis is really put in getting you to utilize your virtual workspaces to focus on one thing at a time. To launch new applications, switch windows or view your workspaces the shell features an _Activities _view which shows you all of your windows along with a launcher (called The Dash) and your virtual workspace switcher seen below. In addition, when you move your cursor into the bottom right corner of the screen it reveals a semi-transparent notification/sys-tray area where your music, messaging and other applications that utilize notifications will reside. This is always visible in the activities view.  ![](http://i.imgur.com/7zDqWl.png) This design has received a lot of criticism from the Linux community with many people wanting to switch to the xfce desktop environment (a lightweight DE which resembles the classic gnome 2.x interface while being more modular and following CDE design ideas). I was also one of the haters at first. However, after using gnome 3.0 for a few days I started to enjoy the new look and feel finding it very intuitive and helping rather than hindering my productivity.  The new shell is largely written in javascript making it very extensible. Extensions are easy to write using javascript and css to integrate directly into the activities view. There isn't much in the way of extensions at this time but as more distros adopt gnome 3.0 and the environment matures shell extensions will allow the new gnome-shell to be as customizable (if not more) than earlier versions of the gnome desktop environment.  Overall, the new design is slick. It is also nice to see some real innovation happening in the world of desktop operating systems and that said innovation is happening on Linux is even better.


## Performance & Stability


I was impressed with the performance of this release. While using gnome 3.0 there was no indication that it is a dot zero release. Everything about the new UI and applications screams stability. The animations are smooth, the shell is generally responsive and overall feels complete. When the shell crashes it displays a chromium like crash screen asking you to log out and back in again. The shell only crashed once on me and it was 100% user error while writing an extension. Myself and a lot of other gnome users were worried about the stability of this release. Gnome has always been one of the most stable and mature desktop environments for Linux. By almost starting from scratch with this new release gnome took a huge risk but pulled it off in the end. After using it and abusing it for a few days it still feels as stable as gnome always has. Even gtk+ applications behave nicely for the most part. However, gtk3 applications are prone to bugs outside of the gnome desktop.


## Final Thoughts


While very different from standard desktop computing conventions that we've came to know and love over the years, gnome 3.0 offers a rich computing experience that helps keep you productive. It works great for netbooks and seems optimized for tablets as well. It utilizes screen space well and could prove the perfect desktop environment for netbooks where android offers too little and Windows is just too heavy.  The extensibility of the shell will help this release of gnome gain steam amongst the community, who as a whole place a high value on the ability to customize and not have decisions made for them (something gnome has been known to do).  Overall, it's nice to see real innovation happening in the Linux desktop world and gnome 3.0 adds a new level of polish and usability to the Linux desktop.
