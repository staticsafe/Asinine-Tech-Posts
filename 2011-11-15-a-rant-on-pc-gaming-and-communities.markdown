One topic nobody ever brings up in the console vs PC debate is the communities that form around them. So I thought I would just put my thoughts out there on why PC gaming is my primary choice and how the community aspect of that formed my decision.



The only points I ever see or hear about is graphics of the games. Sure that's one of many points of why its better and some people really are just graphics whores. The thing is though that even this one aspect of gaming forms its own community around it. The people that build custom computers and overclock their hardware are a massive community. This has even formed an entire industry around enthusiast hardware such as video cards.

Another argument in favor of PC is dedicated servers. Dedicated servers do of course help prevent cheating and improve the overall performance and fairness of the game but it helps form communities. Having an always on place to come hang out and talk to other like minded individuals can create communities. These communities can vary from people who just like to relax to hardcore competitive clans and everything in between.

With the release of Skryim another valid point brought up is mods. These form many communities from the mod developers to the mod players. These communities can outlast even the original game itself and, in combination with my previous point, people running servers can elongate the life of a game indefinitely.

All of this adds up to a very compelling reason for anyone that is into gaming and has the desire and time to commit to a game. Not everyone wants or needs a community which is fine but those who do will find much more value in the PC as a platform.
