If you haven't heard the news already, I encourage you to read this:  [arstechnica.com](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/congress-told-that-internet-data-caps-can-discourage-piracy.ars)

Now, for the lazy ones who think they can gather everything from the title of the article here's the summary: Daniel Castro, an ITIF analyst is lobbying to congress to support government funding of anti-piracy research. In a nutshell, he is trying to get congress to believe that



	
  1. High bandwidth use = piracy, no questions asked

	
  2. Limiting internet users bandwidth and making them pay more money is the only way to stop piracy

	
  3. Internet censorship is good, and the government should censor the net heavily.

	
  4. The government should step back and let the recording industry do whatever they want.


I bet all of this sounds scary right? That's not the half of it, and by now your probably interested in reading the article. Go ahead, I'll wait.




### Worried Yet?


I know I am quite alarmed by this. Clearly, all of the new laws he proposes (and all of which congress is eating up like chocolate cake and ice cream) are a critical violation of our constitutional rights of freedom of speech, right to property, freedom of expression and probably many more. The government really has no business funding this "anti-piracy" research when it cannot even pass a simple budget to cut the ever increasing trillions of dollars of national debt.


### It gets worse


The really sad thing about all this is the reaction of most of my peers. Very few people seem to really care. I honestly don't know if they don't fully understand the consequences this will have, or they assume they will not be affected because they don't pirate anything.

The problem with that mentality is this will affect everyone regardless if you partake in illicit activities or not. If such laws become reality, the cost of broadband at home will skyrocket if you want to be able to do anything useful. It will hurt youtube, netflix, iTunes, and the countless other businesses dependent on users having broadband and high bandwidth caps. What the government does not understand is that high bandwidth use does not always equal piracy.


### The government wants to know what you search for


Probably the scariest thing of all is that this guy, Daniel Castro, is proposing that the government force all ISPs to monitor every single packet coming in and going out. This means that the government will know what websites you visit, what you type into google, what videos you watch on youtube, what movies you watch on Netflix and any other online activity. I am sure nobody wants that, yet why isn't anyone fighting?


### It's time to stand up and fight!


This is our call, as the hacker community as a whole, to finally stand up and fight against these violations of our privacy and our civil rights online. This is our call to stop the corrupt recording industries, the intellectual property zealots and the ever watchful eye of big brother.  It saddens me to see the amount of inaction on the part of the majority of people. It is time to start caring, it is time to protest, it is time **to fight!** Right a letter to your senator, and your congressman, any government official you know. Tell your friends, your family your coworkers. Organize protests. We, the American people can stop this from happening if we get up out of our chairs and fight. The time is now, what will you do?
