**TechnoticRacoon:** Well when I’m not busy watching anime, I do check out whats happening on the Linux scene. Unity is apparently the newest addition to the whole “_screw a DE its a SHELL BIATCH!_” Unity is very pretty and useful, it’s what would happen if Windows and OSX had a very sharp baby. It has a global menu, launcher, and a feature called “_lenses._” A lense is a search panel that can index and search certain things. For Example, in the Gwibber lense, you can see recent posts and search posts by date, user, and time, or in general. Unity also features a full feature launcher, which has a couple features I’d like to talk about. The first is “_peeking autohide_”, While this isn’t really more of a feature than anything. I just think it’s cool. When you have the launcher set to autohide, and you move your mouse towards the launcher area the launcher will “_peek_” out at the rate of which you move your mouse towards it. The next feature that is very smart from unity is “_highlighted association_”. If you drag a file to the launcher, only the applications that support it will highlight. Unity also respects most GTK themes, and all GTK apps and some QT apps will work with the global menu. Unity has been very stable and usable up to this point. The main issue I have with it, is the fact that the global menu is not visible until you move your mouse to the title bar. That is probably bound to confuse a couple users. In all NARWHALS FTW!

**TingPing:** Never used the shit, looks good though.

**Foxwolfblood:** XFCE! FTFW... well anything but Unity.

**staticsafe:** I agree with Foxwolfblood.

**cafejunkie**: Unity is a mistake. In an attempt to cover up the abomination that is the new gnome-shell, Canonical made this horrible shell that does nothing but get in your way and hurts your productivity like nothing the Linux desktop world has seen before. Customization options are severely limited and usability suffers due to obnoxious mouse travel and a 'menu' system for launching applications that will make you cry. In short, Unity should crawl under a rock and hide from the world forever.
