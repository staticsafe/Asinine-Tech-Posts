On March 11th, Twitter made [ an official API announcement that they want 3rd party app developers to scrap their apps and stop making twitter clients. To quote the announcement:
](http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-api-announce/browse_thread/thread/c82cd59c7a87216a)



> "Our user research shows that consumers continue to be confused by the different ways that a fractured landscape of third-party Twitter clients display tweets and let users interact with core Twitter functions. For example, people get confused by websites or clients that display tweets in a way that doesn’t follow our design guidelines, or when services put their own verbs on tweets instead of the ones used on Twitter. Similarly, a number of third-party consumer clients use their own versions of suggested users, trends, and other data streams, confusing users in our network even more. Users should be able to view, retweet, and reply to @nytimes’ tweets the same way."




## Why is this a bad thing?


Essentially what Twitter is doing is eliminating competing apps. Twitter indirectly stated that they want to control the mobile app market with their Official Twitter Applications. Some would go so far as to say Twitter has turned it's back on the community that helped it grow to the massive size it is today. Let's break it down,



	
  1. **Twitter will have the sole responsibility of delivering advanced features to users.** We have seen time and time again that when one organization controls a piece of software it can be near impossible to get the features we as users need into that software. Without the competing 3rd party apps, Twitter on mobile devices will lag behind the other social networking giants.

	
  2. **The official Twitter apps as they stand now suck.** A bold statement indeed, but from my perspective, and the perspective of many other users the official Twitter apps suck compared to the 3rd party alternatives. Especially "Twitter for iPhone" and "Twitter for BlackBerry."

	
  3. **What about money?** What if Twitter decides it wants to start charging for their official mobile apps? I wouldn't be surprised if that was the case either. Without the competition from 3rd party apps what choice would users have but to pay for the official Twitter app or use the sub par mobile website?




## What's the bottom line?


The underlying issue is that Twitter sees dollar signs here. This is about money rather than user experience. Had it been about user experience from the beginning Twitter could simply have not made an API publicly available. The bottom line is Twitter now sees the money potential in the mobile app market and wants to get rid of competition. A move which will anger a lot of users and drive them to other platforms.


## What can you do?


As a Twitter user you do have a choice. If you disagree with Twitter's move, why not help out identi.ca go mainstream? It is a free and open platform. Are you a developer? Shift your focus to making some awesome identi.ca mobile apps! Show Twitter that open is best and that their decision will only hurt them in the end.
