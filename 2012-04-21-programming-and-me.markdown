Wow, writing this post at 12:26 AM on the 21st while listening to k-pop, so excuse any random rambling. Eh, rambling? What the hell, this is my blog, I post whatever the hell I want to.........

(And no I'm not high)



Getting on topic, this post is about programming and how much I love it and what it means to me (yes, I know that sounds so damned corny). Programming is a sort of weird thing for me, sometimes I hate it (Ugh indentation errors!), sometimes I'm like "COMPUTERS ARE AMAZING".

You know that feeling when you are working on a tricky bit of code and it's getting quite complicated, and you go to debug it and it actually frigging works? Best feeling ever. You are all like, "that was probably written by an Italian because that is some goddamn good-looking spaghetti", and then the sinking feeling five minutes later when your annoying Perl loving friend on IRC tells you he could do that with an ugly ass one liner. But whatever, he can keep his oh-so-beautiful regexp(es?) and I can go write that beautifully indented Python (oh wait, didn't I say I hated indentation errors?) But hey, I'm not here to start a flame war between Perl and Python fanboys. Speaking of indentation errors...

My next favourite (and yes that is how you spell that word, contrary to what my browser's spellchecker tells me) topic is editors. I bet you are like, "oh man, this guy wants to start another flame war even after what he said in the last paragraph". My thoughts on editors? I'm mostly a vim guy but I love me some Sublime Text 2 and Notepad++ and Kate and Geany and...you get the point. I write code in whatever editor I feel suits my mood at the time. vim when I have to hand in that annoying C# assignment due the next day, Sublime Text 2 when I want to look at some pretty code, not writing some, Notepad++ for when I want to write a text file that doesn't actually have any (pseudo)code in it at all, Kate for when I want to spend time making my Linux desktop pretty...more like not opening it at all and spending hours customizing KDE. Geany is an odd one, the only thing I prefer it for is writing shell scripts. Go figure.

Yeah, that last paragraph was probably terrible, but I guess it gets the point across.

Version control systems? I absolutely love Git and by extension [Github](https://github.com/staticsafe). I also occasionally use SVN, don't hate it but I don't love it either. Never used hg, cvs, bzr etc.

**I love programming and would like to do it as for long as I can.** (Bolded, just cause.)

Now if you will excuse me, I have to go debug a particularly annoying bit of Python (I absolutely love functions that generate generator objects...yeah not really.)

P.S - Something [cool](https://github.com/github/gitignore) for you git lovers.
