Have you been searching for a way to download and convert video's and music from sites like YouTube, Vimeo, or many others but while using Linux? Well look no further. An open source application called Clip Grab does just that in one great looking little package.



Clip Grab is the little downloader that could. It's jam-packed with a ton of useful features that make it really handy in a jiff. You can search for videos directly from the application or simply use good ol' copy and paste with a YouTube link. Once done it gives you the option to select the format and the quality. Then clip grab magically downloads and converts it all for you.

If you are like me and using Ubuntu, you can get clip grab in a few easy steps:
`
sudo apt-add-repository ppa:clipgrab-team/ppa`

`sudo apt-get update`

`sudo apt-get install clipgrab`

If you are one of the many not using Ubuntu, have no fear. Clip Grab works on Windows and OS X along with Linux. It is super easy to get on those systems as well. Just head over to [http://clipgrab.de](http://clipgrab.de/en) to snag a download for your OS.
