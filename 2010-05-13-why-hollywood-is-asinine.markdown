Hollywood is stupid. No, not the actors or the directors or the other 'artists' involved in it. I'm talking specifically about the [RIAA](http://www.riaa.com/) and the [MPAA](http://www.mpaa.org/).

Why?

Read after the jump!



This is why. Today, the ISP (CB3ROB) that hosts [The Pirate Bay](http://thepiratebay.org/) was hit with an [injunction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injunction) with the conditions being to stop hosting the Pirate Bay or face large fines.

This is what the owner Sven Olaf Kamphuis had to say in response:


> "The Pirate Bay is a search engine for the BitTorrent protocol, and therefore fully legit, and if its users don't have a  distribution license for any content that would require such, guess  who's to blame for not selling it to them in the first place, but  preferring old distribution channels instead, which pollute the  environment and constitute unfair competition."


I agree with the points he made, especially the environmental one. Think about it - how much plastic is used to make CDs/DVDs and CD/DVD cases?

He also says that Disney is run by "clueless idiots". (Heheh)

He also says that by the studios doing this, they are in fact harming themselves:


> "They may be unaware of this, but the provider protection, which  requires carriers to relay traffic from and to any connected party, is  the only thing that keeps Disney and Paramount on the Internet in the  first place."


I completely agree with this. ISPs are dumb pipes and that's all they should aspire to be. Also, is this a threat?

And the best part:


> "help put those dinosaurs out of their misery, and **stop them from  harassing all kinds of new business models and the general population  because of their 'all important movies,' which nobody asked them to make  in the first place.**"


Read the bolded part. I basically was cheering for this guy silently for 5 minutes.

So, what do you think?

P.S - Also, the local [Pirate Party](http://www.pirateparty.ca/).
