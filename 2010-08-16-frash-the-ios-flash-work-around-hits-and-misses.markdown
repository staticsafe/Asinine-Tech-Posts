CNET reports: "a new third-party tool that cropped up this past weekend for jailbroken iPhones and iPads that adds Adobe Flash compatibility to these devices," called Frash.

The tool was created by @comex et. al., the creators of the popular new iOS 4 jailbreak, JailBreakMe.

Wile not being able to play any games, or load videos, the tool comes in handy for Flash-only sites with objects such as restaurant menus, the tool is invaluable for iDevice users.

It comes at some risks, however:
â€¢ Voiding your warranty agreement with Apple
â€¢ Relying on a vulnerability that was patched by Apple on Wednesday
â€¢ Trusting software from an untested source?

Enjoy!
