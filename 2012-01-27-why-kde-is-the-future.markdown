#### KDE, not Unity, is the future of desktop GNU/Linux.




If you haven't been living under a rock this past week you probably know that the KDE Software Compilation version 4.8.0 has been released. This version brings a lot of great improvements and in my opinion is the best KDE release to date. Among the rather large list of new features, this release includes several kwin optimizations, the blur effect has been fixed, a new dolphin view engine, improvements to gwenview, a new QML splash screen (as well as most of the plasma widgets being ported to QML), the new Secret Service framework and many more. Rather than bore you with all the details which can be obtained from the [announcement page](http://kde.org/announcements/4.8/), I'm going to visually showcase why KDE had it right all along.

#### Say Hello to KDE


[![](http://i.imgur.com/Bj7c6.png)](http://i.imgur.com/p6ItU.png)

Since it's inception, KDE has held true to the classic desktop metaphor that we've all come to love over the past 20 years. Refined to perfection, KDE is both visuall appealing and functional allowing users to work in an environment that is both familiar and quite powerfull. Customizable to the extreme, the KDE project believes in giving users the freedom to work in the environment of their choosing. Whether that environment is a classic desktop, a netbook interface or even on tablets, KDE can adapt to multiple form factors without sacrificing usability; something which the other Linux desktops have failed to accomplish.

The GNOME team have only now just incorporated search into their (albeit limited) system settings application. It's a wonderful feature, and kudos to them but KDE has had this since 3.x. As you can see above, KDE goes beyond just search and even hilights what each module contains for easy discoverability. While that may be a trivial feature, the amount of options available in KDE is not. Unlike other environments, the KDE team decides not to treat you, the user, like an idiot. Rather than force decisions on you and assume you will use your computer a certain way, KDE gives you every option you could need and assumes you will want to use your computer in the way that you want. This may seem overwhelming to some, but KDE also has sane defaults for everything and is perfectly usable out of the box with no configuration at all. It's this attitude towards users that will ensure KDE has a long and bright future, far ahead of the direction Unity is taking.


### Looks are good, but it's what makes KDE tick that is awesome.




While looks and user experience are all important aspects of a desktop environment, it's the backend that powers it all that ultimately matters most. Without a solid back-end all you have are pretty pictures. While many would credit Unity and gnome for pioneering many great Linux Desktop features, what most fail to realize is they all started out as KDE technologies. I know what you are thinking, "Wait. Did he just say 'ALL' features?" Why yes, yes I did. I'll show you.







#### **KIO**


KIO is a technology pioneered by KDE to handle accessing things such as network shares, digital cameras, MP3 players, and other devices seamlessly through the file manager. It works using what are called "KIO Slaves." Thanks to KIO slaves, you can seamlessly browse the contents of your iPod, Windows share, NAS, digital camera, Android phone, ftp server and anything else you can dream of. Sounds a lot like gvfs (now GIO, coincidence? I think not). Only KIO came to be in 1996. GIO? It just to _almost _have feature parity with KIO in 2010.


#### **Phonon**


Phonon is the sound architecture in KDE. It is a front end to managing sound devices, mixers and a plethora of other options. But wait, what's so special about Phonon? Don't other desktop environments manage sound just fine? Well yes, they do if you only like to have one backend to handle your system's sound. Phonon supports using VLC, Alsa, Pulse Audio, OSS and Jack as audio backends without hassle. It is literally as simple as opening up system settings and choosing your option from a list. Unity (and gnome) by attempting to be "simple" completely lacks this functionality. Did I mention KDE has had this ability since the first 5.x release?


#### **KDE PIM**


KDE PIM. Love it or hate it, this suite of Applications is unmatched on any other Linux desktop that exists. It is the Microsoft Outlook of Linux and I mean that in a good way. In one application (or separate if you choose, remember KDE is about freedom) you can manage your email, contacts, calendar, RSS feeds, notes, blog and to-do list. You can store information locally, or keep in sync via any number of protocols.  This entire system got a major overhaul in the 4.7 release and has been polished in 4.8.0, I encourage you to give it a try to find out for yourself why Evolution is no match.


#### **KDE Applications**


While not a back-end feature, the KDE suite of applications deserves a mention. The suite of applications that are part of the KDE SC have no match on other desktop environments, and even on other platforms. While the Unity and Gnome camp have touted the features of applications like Shotwell, Banshee, and the like, they don't even come close to their KDE counter parts. In fact, people who find themselves missing feature packed Windows only applications on Linux need to look no further than the KDE SC. Lets take a look at Gwenview for example.



[![](http://i.imgur.com/gcnTu.png)](http://i.imgur.com/TNK4i.png)

In this one application you can rate, tag, organize, crop, resize, reduce red eye, create slideshows, rotate and share your images with a ridiculous number of services via plugins including Facebook, Picasa, imgur, twitpic and many more. That's not all Gwenview can do but it's features are far too many to list in this post so why not install it and give it a whirl, I guarantee you'll never go back to another photo management application again.

Another application worth mentioning specifically is Blogilo, which this very post was written in. Ever since the release if Windows 7 I've been searching for a Linux application that was on par with Windows Live Writer. I tried a variety of gnome applications (since that's what I was using at the time) but none of them came even close. Then I discovered Blogilo.



[![](http://i.imgur.com/9wKNz.png)](http://i.imgur.com/VBlzk.png)

Blogilo can connect to any number of weblog services and allow you to both edit old posts and create new ones. It can assign categories, tags and much more. It can edit HTML, Visually and even show you a preview of what the post would look like using your blog's theme. It also supports as many blogs as you want to add to it.

Some other KDE Applications that far exceed anything that follows the Unity/Gnome philosophy:



	
  * Amarok - A music player with everything but the kitchen sink

	
  * Ktorrent - On par, if not better than, uTorrent on Windows

	
  * Dolphin - The KDE file manager that is easily the best file manager on Linux

	
  * Digikam - Simply the best digial camera photo management software in the world

	
  * k3b - Light years ahead of Braserro and on par with UltraISO on Windows. Just ask my stack of failed DVDs from Brassero

	
  * KSecretService - A password management backend that is compatible with GNOME's for interoperability

	
  * Kate - A really advanced programmer's text editor with support for GDB integration, call stack browser, SQL statement tester and many more features

	
  * Okular - Hands down the best document reader across all platforms.




If you aren't convinced that KDE is the future yet, I encourage you to try out this new release. The Kubuntu guys have it all packaged up and ready to go in their backports repository if you need an easy way to install it. It is well worth it, and once you get KDE set up the way you want it you will be happy you said so long to GNOME and Unity. Afterall, there is a good reason why most of the freedesktop.org standards started out as KDE technologies.










_note: I was going to include a screencast to demonstrate the awesomeness of this KDE release but due to technical limitations of my laptop, I was unable to. I encourage you to stay tuned to this post as I will manage to have a screencast posted in the coming week. Thanks for reading!_
