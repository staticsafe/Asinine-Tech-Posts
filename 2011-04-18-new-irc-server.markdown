Yep, you read that right. We now have moved away from our channel in Freenode to our very own IRCd!

The decision was made because I wanted more capabilities then what Freenode's services could provide me with and also I didn't quite agree with all of Freenode's policies.

Our IRC server details are as follows:

Server : irc.entropynet.net
Ports: 6667, 6697(for SSL)

We do have services setup, so feel free to register your nick with NickServ.

Our main channel is #EntropyNet, and some other interesting channels:



	
  * #ascii - paste ASCII art in here

	
  * #caffeine-linux - the developer channel for the Caffeine Linux distribution

	
  * #rant - rant your heart out in here

	
  * #minecraft - talk about minecraft in here

	
  * #links - have an IRC server that you want to link with our IRCNET? Join us in here, and speak to a operator.


Staff members (aka operators):

staticsafe, fox & linuxnja

Be sure to connect and chill out with us, we don't bite. :P

P.S - Don't know how to use IRC? Read [this](http://staticsafe.ca/post/767570851/irc-rat).
