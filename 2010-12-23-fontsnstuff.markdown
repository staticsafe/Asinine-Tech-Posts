As you can tell, we are currently not using the Tahoma font! (Yay to diverging from Microsoft) We are now using the Ubuntu font which is the default font in the Ubuntu Linux distribution.

It is open source and free to use, so if you want it on your system you can get it [here](http://font.ubuntu.com).

_EDIT by staticsafe:_

Font is powered by [Google Font Directory](http://code.google.com/webfonts).
