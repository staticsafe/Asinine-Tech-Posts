(It's a bird, no a plane, no it's.... another social browser!)

Rockmelt, Oh Rockmelt. It;s seems that where ever I go there is some attempt to make me more social, but maybe this time it actually works. Rockmelt is a Social web browser based off of chromium v6. It's a little out of date but chrome = fast so we all still win! Now lets get down to this, there are 3 main features of this browser that you and I care about.





	
  * A Friend Edge That shows all of your Facebook friends

	
  * A App Edge that shows your Facebook feeds, RSS feeds, and chromium extensions

	
  * An actual search bar

	
  * A Firefox/opera inspired options menu




### Friend Edge?


[![melt2](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/melt2_thumb.png)](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/melt2.png) (Blacked out cause you guys don't need to know about my social life [Or lack of])

All your friends show up here and when you click on their picture, you can open up a Facebook chat window, send a message with them or share a link. And you can manage your favorite friends.


### App Edge?


[![melt3](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/melt3_thumb.png)](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/melt3.png) (This is epic!)

In this edge you have 3 things, 1) RSS feeds, 2) Chromium Extensions, 3) Facebook/Twitter feeds. When you click the add button on the bottom of the tab, you can do 3 things, 1) add RSS feed from your most visited sites, 2) add one from the current site, 3) manage the chromium extension icons.


### Search Bar?


The search bar is a (drum roll please) a Google search bar! You can't change it from anything besides Google though, so if you use Bing like me then your screwed.


### Options menu?

(isn't this familiar?)

Well it's practically the wrench menu but moved!


### Conclusion


Rockmelt is a good browser, it has a great base. But I'd love to see some better twitter integration and more sites like foursquare and LinkedIn. Since it's an invite only beta you need to sign up @ [http://www.rockmelt.com](http://www.rockmelt.com) In all good idea, good base, just needs better implementation.

PS. This is for windows/osx atm, sorry Linux users. ![Sad smile](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/wlEmoticon-sadsmile.png)
