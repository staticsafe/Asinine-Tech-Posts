A friend of mine ([@stephenou](http://twitter.com/stephenou)) has a very awesome project that he started called [OneExtraLap](http://onextralap.com). This is the total opposite to the my last Formspring [post](http://asininetech.com/2010/05/20/formspring-is-asinine/).

It's all about social quizzing. You might ask what makes OEL different from any other site on the internet:


> Unlike other quizzing websites, OneExtraLap allows you to  play around  with quizzes in a social way. Simply create a quiz on what you know and  let your friends test their knowledge. Or take one of your friend's quiz  and share your score to the world!

Now, the site is currently invite only, and I have 2 invites to give away. Get 'em as soon as possible!
