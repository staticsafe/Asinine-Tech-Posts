Feedly for the web is a web based version of the feedly app which you can get on iOS and Android. Feedly is a "replacement for google reader" as they say. Feedly is one of the most popular apps on the iOS app store, but on android it isn't one of the best due to it's beta status. It features integration with twitter and your google reader RSS list to make a "optimized" for a better and clean interface.







When you open up the main window you get a list of what feeds are the most popular, via twitter mentions and google reader likes. You can add RSS feeds, categorize and organize you feeds, and you get twitter updates and general info about your feed.




The main "reading" pane consists of 3 areas. The first area has the title, a link to a preview and a link to the original site. You can also hide/minimize the pane. The next area also has a bookmark/like buttons, and social media sharing links for about everything...seriously they have every single social network site.




The reading pane justifies the text with an easy to read font. They crop and size each image to fit your screen size, and videos are made to be in the same area as they would be in the actual post. The only bad thing though, is the fact that only youtube flash videos are supported.




Other miscellaneous features that feedly features are: instapaper save for later style folders, Full keyboard shortcut support, HTML offline support, multiple column view options, and suggestions for adding feeds based off of twitter followers and currently added feeds.




In all, feedly is one of the best, if not the best RSS feed readers out there for the web. It has a lot of hidden features that make your reading experience much better. I know I haven't touched on everything, but since this is a free web app. Why not try for yourself? Try it now at [http://feedly.com/home](http://feedly.com/home)
