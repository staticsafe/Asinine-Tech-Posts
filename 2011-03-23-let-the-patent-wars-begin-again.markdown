It can be hard to keep track of all the on going intellectual property lawsuits. Today two pretty big players in the tech world have unleashed the latest assault Tuesday that proves a grave need for patent reform.Microsoft and Apple, being no strangers to intellectual property lawsuits have filed new claims that are filled with patents screaming to be invalidated. Microsoft is is suing Barnes & Noble, Inventec and Foxconn for infringing on five patents in Android, which is used on Barnes & Noble's Nook and Nook color.

This is the next step in Microsoft's strategy of targeting licensees of Android instead of Google, which would have directly infringed on patents by developing Android in the first place. This was seen in October, when it sued Motorola on the same general grounds.


### Microsoft Can't Keep Up


One of the patents Microsoft is suing over, although needs to be invalidated on prior art, shouldn't come as any surprise. Patent 6,891,551 ("Selection handles in editing electronic documents," aka copying and cutting text). Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 still does not have copy & paste functionality. It would seem Microsoft can't keep up in the mobile world so it plans to sue over a feature it's own product lacks to gain an edge up.


### Apple is at it again


[![Apple App Store Logo](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/app_store_logo_1-150x150.jpg)](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/app_store_logo_1.jpg)Now, Apple's new lawsuit isn't as objectionable as Microsoft's i.e. it's not trying to tax an entire segment of the mobile ecosystem. But, it is still ridiculous nonetheless. On Friday, Apple sued Amazon over the name of Amazon's new Android store, the "Amazon Appstore." Apple states that Amazon's use of that name "will confuse and mislead customers."

As ridiculous as it is to sue over the term "App Store," Apple's statement that the Amazon Appstore is not founded on any research. Here's the truth, the Amazon Appstore will not confuse or mislead anyone. "App Store" has become a relatively generic term in everyday speech for any site or program that will let you download software with one click. Amazon could call their new app store the "Amazon Mobile Software Shop" and people will still call it "Amazon's app store."


### Back to Microsoft


As for Microsoft, massive industry-wide licensing of Microsoft's patents is not the solution. Throwing out these terrible software patents is the solution. Until that happens (which I fear will not be anytime soon), Microsoft may collect some extra royalty fees from companies like Amazon, and HTC that found it easier to settle than to fight in court. But, for all the extra money Microsoft might earn from this it certainly won't gain any respect.


### Bottom Line


The bottom line is, the USA patent system needs to be reformed. Things have gotten way out of hand with intellectual property lawsuits. Instead of moving forward we are stuck in an endless cycle of slow development of new technology for fear of stepping on each others toes over intellectual property.
