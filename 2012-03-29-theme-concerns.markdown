So I've been told that the current theme is ugly. Yeah, it doesn't have fancy CSS animations and backgrounds with fancy fonts using the Google Fonts API (and [fuck Roboto](http://typographica.org/on-typography/roboto-typeface-is-a-four-headed-frankenstein/) for web pages).




But hey, its damned readable and clean. So unless you have a theme that is :




a) clean and readable




b) not filled with a shit ton of JavaScript




c) preferably not fixed-width




Don't bother telling me to change it.
