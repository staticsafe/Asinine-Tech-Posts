Well, this sort sucks. AT&T is now the only gsm company in the US. Huzzah!...... not really. The only good thing about this is the fact that AT&T has access to t-mobiles infrastructure which means that AT&Ts service should get better. And AT&T does get all of t-mobiles android phones so.... Yay!.... maybe? I dunno, this just is meh.
