"The Air Force swears there was no panic. But for three-quarters of an hour  Saturday morning, launch control officers at F.E. Warren Air Force Base in  Wyoming couldnâ€™t reliably communicate or monitor the status of 50 Minuteman III  nuclear missiles. Gulp."Â _Wired.com_

Isn't this a bit ridiculous? I would be panicked if I knew there was a nuke in my general area that wasn't being actively controlled.

Caused by a single hardware failure, around 50 missile silos were lost, reported with the error "launch facility down". The issue was thought to be serious enough that the highest ranking members of the US military, (even the President) was briefed on the incident.

Although incidents similar to this have occurred in the past, 50 nukes dropping off at once is "an anomaly of anomalies".

Thoughts?
