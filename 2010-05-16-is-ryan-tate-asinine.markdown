Apparently, it is trendy to directly contact the CEO of a multi-billion dollar company with a cult following with complaints.

I think by now you all know who this CEO is. Yes, it's Steve Jobs.

Ryan Tate on the other hand is the editor of Valleywag aka. Gawker.

If you have been the following the debacle of the stolen iPhone, you know that Gawker (especially Gizmodo) is not very popular with the tech audience right now.

You can read the whole e-mail exchange between Messieurs Jobs and Tate [here](http://gawker.com/5539717/).

Read more after the jump!



I'll just comment on what I think is the most important part of the conversation:

Firstly, I would like to say that Jobs shouldn't have replied at all. This is because the only reason this is 'news' is because he replied.

Also, my thoughts on Gawker: Page-view seeking whores. Why would they want to do something like this after the whole stolen iPhone debacle? Why can't they just STFU till the issue dies down? Obviously, doing this gets them more page views, nothing else.

Thoughts on Tate: I think the final e-mail just destroyed him (metaphorically). As Jobs said, he seems to be the person who 'just criticizes others work and belittles their motivations'. As one commenter pointed out, Tate should take this as free advice. Think about it.

Do you think Ryan Tate is asinine? Or is Steve Jobs?
