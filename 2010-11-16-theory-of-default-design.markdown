So, you might have noticed that we have defaulted back to the default theme for Wordpress 3.0.

I think that the default theme is very customizable for our needs. Also, some of the other themes were having issues.

Things that need to be customized:



	
  * Header image

	
  * Background

	
  * Custom menus

	
  * Ads

	
  * Footer text


**Some forums news**

The forums will be moved to a new server soon. Of course, no data will be lost in the process as I will be doing a database and file backup and then restoring it to the new server. This will be done as soon as I get the new server.

The forums are the only thing moving to the new server, this blog will stay on the current server for now.

**Reader/user input**

If you have any comments/theme suggestions, please feel free to comment below, or let me know in our IRC channel - #asininetech on Freenode (I'm staticsafe).

**EDIT 1:**

Since the issue with the Lightword theme has been fixed, we have now switched to that.
