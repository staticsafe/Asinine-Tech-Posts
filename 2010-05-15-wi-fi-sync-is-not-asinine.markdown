I have been following the story of an app. Not just any app but the [Wi-Fi Sync](http://getwifisync.com/) app.

Yes, this app allows you to sync your iPhone/iPod Touch to iTunes via **Wi-Fi**. That's right, no cable needed.

Read more after the jump!



But, guess what happened? Apple has rejected the app (I kind of knew this was going to happen, but a guy can have dreams right?).

This app maker is smart. Instead of giving up, and disappearing he has posted his app to the Cydia app repository.

This is a screenshot of the app in Cydia:

All you need to obtain this app is a [jailbroken](http://spiritjb.com/) iDevice and a credit card.




Yes, unlike many apps on the Cydia repositories this one isn't free. In fact, it commands a steep price (for an app).




Another thing, the desktop counterpart to this app is only currently  available for OSX. The author says that the Windows version is coming  soon, so if you don't own a Mac you might hold on to your money.




Will you pay for an app like this? Honestly, this may be one of the most useful apps out there.
