So on a whim today, I decided to change the theme to Plainscape.

And I like it! It's simple and just works.

Recently, Lightword seems to be having a strange issue, it stops displaying the blog's pages on the top bar.

I'm too lazy to troubleshoot (it's probably one of the plugins) so I just switched themes.

**EDIT1:**

Changing from the Lightword theme also broke the /irc page so I replaced that page with a direct link to my IRC channel.

You will need an IRC client of some sort to open the link, for a list of popular clients refer to this [post](http://staticsafe.me/post/767570851/irc-rat).

And this theme isn't permanent.

Thoughts?
