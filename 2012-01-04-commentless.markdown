Well, once again MG Siegler has done it again; wrote an article on Tumblr that somehow ends up affecting a some random web sites out there. [Link](http://parislemon.com/post/15305835451/bile)

He makes many good points, and the article in question _he_ was talking about makes good points. So that leads to today, where we decided to jump on the bandwagon and turn off comments. The bottom line is this, "these are _our_ words and _you_ don't_ _have the right to put _your_ words on it." Does that make us sound like a bunch of dicks? Of course. Do we have a good reason for this? Yep.

Don't get me wrong here, comments are a _great _thing when done right. But there lies the issue. For every good comment, there is around 5 more ones that add no value and just add trash to the site. And for those who do actually write cohesive and great comments that are tasteful and add value? We are sorry, this was not meant to offend you in any manner. But with the couple other hundred ways you have to contact the author, the hope is that you will partake in that.

To summarize, we have better things to do (like make articles of good quality) then moderate comments all day. Now I know this blog isn't that popular compare to other more spam-filled ones. But you could ask anyone who watches over their comments and you would be told that it is a pain.

As always, thank you for reading and have a great day.

(Due to the lack of comments, if you want to actually discuss this with me, you can contact me via a plethora of ways. [Twitter](http://twitter.com/technoticracoon)[,](http://twitter.com/technoticracoon) [Google+](https://plus.google.com/113065569337723072601/posts) )
