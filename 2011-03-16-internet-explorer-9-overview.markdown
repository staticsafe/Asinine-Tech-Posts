IE9 has been pushed out this week, so i thought id do an overview just to show whats new. I will mostly be covering the look and feel though as i already covered the performance in a previous post which you can read [here](http://asininetech.com/2011/03/12/browserbenchmarks/).  But to sum up the performance its phenomenal compared to IE8 and even faster than the upcoming Firefox 4 release.


<!-- more -->


First major UI change is the address bar. Gone are the days of a separate search box and address bar (something I've been doing for years with add-ons).

As you can see the default address bar shares space with tabs which can become a huge issue to anybody that visits more than a few sites. Since they beta they have added an option to change that though.

Another major change was the new tab page, as you can see its very similar to some of the other browsers out, which isn't a bad thing. Just like in chrome that page shows recently closed tabs, but unlike chrome the hide sites button only hides the pictures of sites and doesn't actually remove those squares which isn't very elegant.

The only negative aspect of the new UI is the menu and bookmarks bar, they don't look bad but they do look a little out of place.

The last UI change I noticed was the Download window. Dont really have much to say about it though.

Overall its a great update with much needed overhaul in performance and looks.
