(Note: This has sat in my to-post pile for a while, so some of the information may be outdated)

Capcom, makes some of (arguably) best games out there. I’m sure many of you remember yelling at your TV set while playing Megaman back in the NES days. But recently it seems that Capcom has put other things in front of its main game series. Marvel Vs. Capcom 3 doesn’t have Megaman in the roster of characters and they are charging much much more than they should for what is bug fixes and a couple of extra characters. And the best of all, a new mode that should have been there from the start! I’m starting to think that Capcom is starting to loose sight of what it should be doing as a company. The earlier Resident Evil games were better than the latest entries in the series, for example.  The thing that has really started to make me disappointed in Capcom is the cancellation of 2 games. One being Megaman legends 3 for the 3ds and the other being Megaman universe for the Xbox 360 and PS3.

Fans are starting to get a bit angry at Capcom as stated [here](http://www.capcom-unity.com/go/suggestion/box), [here](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/07/18/mega-man-legends-3-canceled.aspx#comments), [here](http://www.joystiq.com/2011/07/18/mega-man-legends-3-project-canceled/#comments), [here](http://www.gamespot.com/3ds/rpg/mega-man-legends-3/news/6324412/mega-man-legends-3-officially-cancelled#comments), [here](http://www.moetron.com/2011/07/18/mega-man-legends-3-officially-canceled#comments) and [here](http://www.siliconera.com/2011/07/18/mega-man-legends-3-canceled-prototype-version-also-canned#comments). What seems to make Capcom enthusiasts the most frustrated is the cancellation of Megaman legends 3. Megaman Legends 3 had 2 releases planned for it, a prototype version and the real game. The prototype version was going to be a collection of levels explaining what happened before the real game takes place. Capcom had released a dev room where players could make characters and designs and share with other players and the developers of the game would peer in from time to time to see the most popular. Capcom said the game was canceled due to lackluster support for the dev room, but noted in the links above, I’m pretty sure that was inaccurate.

Most people have been saying that the cancellation of the project has something to do with the fact the Keji Inafune left Capcom late last year. He was one of the big drivers at Capcom and he started the 2 games that were canceled.

So today Capcom should do some rethinking of its strategy, fans aren’t very happy in the direction they are going in. And at the end of the day we gamers loose out on games that we want and know will be good. And Megaman fans never get to find out what happens at the end of Megaman legends.  The only thing that you, as gamers can do is going to their forums and suggestions pages and make it known that they are killing games that you want to play. My suggestion to them would be just to actually go ahead with the game due to the fact that it was in development and there is working versions of it out there. And if you check the comments section of any site posting about the games being killed, you can see that the fans are mad. So if you want your voice to be heard on what companies do, all it takes is talking in the right places.
