_I have been wanting to do a whole big rant on user interfaces for a while, but that would be a really big article. So instead I think I will be doing weekly rants on one subject...._

__ Windows as a OS on a whole has no "Right" way to do a UI for an app. No one says you have to use this feature or this specific look. But oh, people do make some of the most ugliest thing's I've seen in my life.


Example: [![](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screenshot-2011-08-25-at-05.52.38.png)](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screenshot-2011-08-25-at-05.52.38.png)




Now, I am not trying to pick on the developers of ooVoo, as it is a pretty good service. But oh god- look at that window. That is probably the best app I can think of that just screws up when it comes to the UI department. And yes some will argue that it just works, but it works terribly. Design isn't just how something looks and feels, it's how something works. And this works fairly bad. The first problem with it is that well, it uses nothing that makes it remotely look like a windows app. I've seen something thrown together in QT in 5 minutes that looks prettier.




And I hate to say it, but Skype does that UI right. Things are just thrown around with ooVoo, And this app has no need for the big button menu bar at the top. I would suggest using aero more and replacing the menu bar with a menu icon. There is just too much wasted space, and that advertisement.... it's big, obtrusive, and use flash. I don't care if there is an ad in my app, but don't blast it at me.  Basically, they just need to keep it simple and clean.




Example 2:

This app could just have a menu icon and still be just as functional. But you still would have that row of buttons and the search bar. This is pure opinion as people do hate it, but a ribbon is probably the best way to display the content the app is trying to show you. And yes there is Outlook....but it is Outlook, slow as balls but has a great UI. And Mozilla could just stick it's own implementation of the ribbon in there. The UI is overly-simplified to the point of it being complex.




Now, there are some app's that have great UI's and do it well.




Example: [![](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screenshot-2011-08-25-at-06.31.58-1024x733.png)](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/Screenshot-2011-08-25-at-06.31.58.png)


Ironically, Mozilla's other main app, Firefox does it perfectly. Minimalist, good use of the menu button instead of a bar, and it uses Aero properly.

To summarize,  you really don't need to make your app look like every other app in the system. But keeping it simple and minimalist, and actually using Aero when it can be used- Can really help make your app easy to use and appealing to new users. Now, there are app's made for niches that shouldn't follow this, an IDE for example probably would be terrible with a menu button, same goes for a advanced photo editor...



EDIT* Per request of staticsafe, here is one more example of a god-awful UI:
