So yesterday Google released a newly redesigned Market for its Android operating system. It is for all devices running 2.2 or higher.

New features include:



	
  * new ways to find great applications and games

	
  * completely redesigned UI

	
  * books and movies for purchase (US only for now)


Read more after the jump.



Here are some screenshots (taken on a Samsung Galaxy S Captivate):

As you can see, the app has a completely redesigned UI, that definitely feels much smoother than the previous version. You can also swipe through all the different "screens" such as the featured, top paid, top free etc.

Here is a video released by Google that demonstrates the new UI:

Google is pushing out the updates to phones around the world soon, but if you can't wait to get your hands on the new Market (like me) you can sideload the APK file which can be downloaded from [here](http://www.4shared.com/file/kyNUMuu_/comandroidvending-new.html?). I have tested the APK on my own phone (Galaxy S Captivate) and all the functions of the app work great without any obvious issues.
