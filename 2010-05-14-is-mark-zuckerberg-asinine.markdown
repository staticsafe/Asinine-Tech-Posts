Well is he? According to a IM chat conversation uncovered by [Silicon Alley Insider](http://www.businessinsider.com/well-these-new-zuckerberg-ims-wont-help-facebooks-privacy-problems-2010-5), he probably is.

Read it after the jump.



This is the conversation:


> _Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard_

_Zuck: Just ask._

_Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS_

_[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?_

_Zuck: People just submitted it._

_Zuck: I don't know why._

_Zuck: They "trust me"_

_Zuck: Dumb fucks._


Now, we ought to take this conversation with a grain of salt. SAI has said that "there is no context for Zuckerberg's remarks, if they are indeed his, and there's  no way to tell if these comments reflect how he really viewed matters  of privacy when he was building Facebook."

But if this is indeed true, does this change your opinion of Facebook?

Oh, and I will not be deactivating my Facebook account as everyone seems to be doing(stupid trend setters).

Discuss.
