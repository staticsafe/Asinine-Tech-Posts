Look out Humble Bundle fans, theres a new bundle in town; It's called IndieRoyale.
IndieRoyale is a freshly launched indie game bundle, from the same great guys that brought us Desura, indieDB, and modDB. This isn't the pay what you want bundle you are used to though, it has a twist. The price for the bundle starts at $1.99, and increases in price as more people buy it. But if you pay more than the minimum, the price goes down for everyone.



The bundle launched with four great indie games:

The first game is an action packed 2D side scrolling platformer called [A.R.E.S. : Extinction Agenda](http://www.indiedb.com/games/ares).

The second is, as the game's makers describe, "a neo-noir science-fiction point and click adventure." and it is called [Gemini Rue](http://www.indiedb.com/games/gemini-rue).

Third on the list is a science fiction FPS called [Sanctum](http://www.indiedb.com/games/sanctum), it is unique because combines elements of tower defense into its first person gameplay.

And finally, the last game in the bundle is [Nimbus](http://www.indiedb.com/games/nimbus). Nimbus is a 2D side-scroller that mixes puzzle aspects, with racing.

These games are all redeemable on Steam and all except SanctumÂ  can be redeemed on Desura. Sorry Linux guys, this is an all Windows bundle. I speculate heavy Linux support will be added in the future though, due to high demand for it on the Desura website. Unfortunately, the launch bundle is over from now on but I think you can still buy the games if you beat the minimum and a new bundle is coming within a week.

So there you have it, a promising new bundle, happy bundling! Visit [http://indieroyal.com](http://www.indieroyale.com/) for more info.
