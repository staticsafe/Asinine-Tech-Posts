"CNET UK is reporting that it crashed a Â£90,000 Jaguar XJ Super Sport â€” one of the most technologically advanced cars on the planet today. It's not the sort of crash you'd imagine, however â€” An unforseen glitch somewhere within the car's dozens of separate onboard computers, hundreds of millions of lines of code, or its internal vehicular network, led to the dramatic BSOD, which had to be resolved with the use of a web-connected laptop."

Now that's an entire level above the BSOD we Windows users whine about!

The part that got me was the Â "hundreds of millions of lines of code". Now I'm not a coder, but that even scaresÂ _me!_
