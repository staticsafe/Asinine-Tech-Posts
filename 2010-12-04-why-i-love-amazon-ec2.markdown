A month or so before, I was looking for cheap VPS to move my irssi and IRC bot to. A friend on IRC recommended that I try out Amazon EC2. I was quite amazed to find out that they provide a full year of free service on their free tier.

So far it has been awesome. I loaded Ubuntu 10.04 Server edition on to the VPS and rest is just proven by this:


> "17:52:43 up 22 days, 23:01,Â  2 users, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00"


The only thing that bothered me a little was there was no bandwidth monitoring, it was provided at per instance hour charge. Then 2 days I got this e-mail:

Needless, to say I was amazed that they would provide this service to us for free for non-paying customers!

I would recommend Amazon EC2 services to anyone who wants a free or a pay as much as you need system for web hosting needs.
