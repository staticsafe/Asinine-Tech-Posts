As you all probably know, the Google and Samsung event was yesterday, where they announced the Galaxy Nexus and Android 4.0 "Ice Cream Sandwich." As usual with these types of events, we live blog them in [IRC](http://entropynet.net). And the next day we post our findings on the site, sorry that we are a little bit late with this one, but enjoy!

>     23:15 < staticsafe> But there are deeper changes. Matias tells me that starting with Android 4.0, users can uninstall any application they like, such as the native browser or email client and that seems to go for carrier software as well.
