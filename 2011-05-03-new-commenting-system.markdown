I have just moved Asinine Tech over to the [Livefyre](http://livefyre.com/) commenting system from the Disqus commenting system.




The main advantage over Disqus is live updates of comments (i.e without refreshing the page), this cannot be done with Disqus without paying for the $19/mo plan.




I'm asking the other authors (and readers) to help me test out this commenting system.




Feel free to comment on this post!




P.S - As always join us in [IRC](irc://irc.entropynet.net/asininetech).
