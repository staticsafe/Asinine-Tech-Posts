At this recent Ubuntu Developer Summit Mark Shuttleworth set the goal to have 200 Million Ubuntu Users in 4 years. This is great, and Shuttleworth is pushing for a great thing which is getting Free Software in to as many people's hands as possible. Specifically your average end user. The problem however is that the average end user doesn't know what Ubuntu is, or even an operating system for that matter.

Now, this is not Canonical Ltd.'s fault, nor is it the community's. Rather it is modern western capitalist society that prevents Ubuntu from advancing in the main stream consumer market. Let's take a look at some reasons why modern western culture does not foster wide spread adoption of free software.



_*Disclaimer: This is mostly a rant about modern society attitudes and not an attack on Linux_, _Ubuntu or the general open source community. _


#### Reason No. 1: Capitalist Attitudes


Ever hear the phrase "Nothing good is ever free"? To many people in the western world (specifically the US & Canada) that phrase is true about all aspects of life. Because of this consumerist attitude, many users start into the Ubuntu experience with low expectations and when bugs do occur (because let's admit it, Ubuntu with Unity as it is right now is a buggy distro) they immediately toss it up to being a substandard product due to the fact that it was free (gratis). I say gratis because in reality, the majority of users could care less about whether or not it is free as in freedom.


#### Reason No. 2: Users have no right to demand anything.


When a user purchases a license to use Microsoft Windows or Mac OS X they expect to be treated like paying customers (because they are) by having the right to demand bug fixes, features and demand the company to be accountable for their mistakes. With free software however users have no right to demand anything. Most of the developers are volunteers and produce the software on their own time. With free software there is no one entity to hold accountable for when and if things go wrong. This scares many users from making the jump to Ubuntu/free software. Users don't like the fact that there isn't some central entity to throw money at to fix a problem.


#### Reason No. 3: Average Users don't want to RTFM


No matter how much you may want to deny it, the hacker community and almost clannish open source community can be a bunch of arrogant jerks half the time, especially towards new users. I am happy to RTFM because I need to know every little detail about how my system works. That's just my nature. Average users on the other hand don't care about how things work just so long as they work. As hackers we have trouble understanding why anyone wouldn't want to know all the details and view this disinterest in computing as an insult and a sign of blatant stupidity on the part of the user. But, since free software is by nature so customizable and offers so much choice, reading the manual is required. Because of this, average users will avoid it for a product that does everything for them so they do not have to think.


#### Reason No. 4,5,6: It's different, It's different, It's different!


Compared to the common proprietary operating systems, free software innovates and changes at a much faster rate. While we as geeks (most of the time) love this, average users generally hate change. Think of how many people are still using Windows XP, a 9 year old operating system because they don't want change. When average users boot into Ubuntu for the first time and see the ugly step child of Windows 7 and OS X they are going to immediately be turned off and not have an enjoyable computing experience. This lack of consistency, something us Linux users love, is exactly what average users hate. Because of this, all but the most open minded average users will continue to avoid Ubuntu and free software.


#### Reason No. 7: Lack of Integration


Application and Services integration is a big one for average users. Average users generally don't want to think about computing, they just want the complete package ready to go and easy to set up. Ubuntu has started to remedy this by launching Ubuntu One however the proprietary operating systems are a step ahead in this market. I couldn't count how many people are using 100% Microsoft services simply because they've never even heard of Google's offerings or any other alternatives. The reason is because the integration with those services comes out of the box and is very easy to set up. If Ubuntu is serious about attracting 200 Million main stream users then Canonical needs to step up in the online services market in order to offer a complete solution to users. This will be difficult for Canonical as in today's tech culture a complete solution now consists of a smartphone, tablet and generally a laptop (or for some a a netbook instead of a tablet). Each of the tech giants are now offering (or will be offering soon) a complete solution that integrates together very nicely.


#### In a nutshell...


Average users are not ready, nor will they be in the near future, for free software and/or Ubuntu. Taking freedom out of the equation as consumers generally do not care about freedom, the Ubuntu experience isn't complete enough for average users to justify adopting based on it's price (gratis) alone. The dilemma for Canonical Ltd. and Ubuntu is I think the issue of whether to target only these average users and risk, for lack of a better term, pissing off the free software community or to continue in their happy middle path just to keep everyone semi-happy. Canonical either needs to start playing the consumer and capitalist game or never be mainstream. After all, the saying is "Build a better mouse trap and the world will come knocking at your door." Personally, I'd prefer if average users stayed on their current platforms and leave Linux to us, the hackers who really care about freedom.
