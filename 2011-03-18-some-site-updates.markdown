So it's been a while since we have had any major site updates, but we got some exciting news. First off, if you haven't noticed that is, we have a new logo! YAY! It was designed by foxwolfblood who frequents our irc channel. Second piece of news is that we have some new writers on our team! They are cafejunkie, TingPing, and FoxWolfBlood, and we hope to get great material from them. So thats all the news for now, and as always thanks for reading!
