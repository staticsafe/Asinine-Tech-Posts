I'm excited to say that the first stable release of LibreOffice has been released.

Improvements that are in 3.3 so far (as compared to the original OpenOffice source code):



	
  * Import and work with SVG files

	
  * Easy way to format title pages and their numbering in Writer

	
  * Improved Navigator Tool for Writer

	
  * Improved ergonomics in Calc for sheet and cell management

	
  * Microsoft Works and Lotus Word Pro document import filters.


A more complete and detailed list of new features can be found here - [http://www.libreoffice.org/download/new-features-and-fixes/](http://www.libreoffice.org/download/new-features-and-fixes/)

**Why is it such a significant achievement?**


> - the developer community has been able to build their own and  independent process, and get up and running in a very short time (with  respect to the size of the code base and the project's strong  ambitions);

- thanks to the high number of new contributors having been attracted  into the project, the source code is quickly undergoing a major clean-up  to provide a better foundation for future development of LibreOffice;

- the Windows installer, which is going to impact the largest and most  diverse user base, has been integrated into a single build containing  all language versions, thus reducing the size for download sites from 75  to 11GB, making it easier for us to deploy new versions more rapidly  and lowering the carbon footprint of the entire infrastructure.


**Improved Development Cycle**


> CaolÃ¡n McNamara from RedHat, one of the developer community leaders,  comments, "We are excited: this is our very first stable release, and  therefore we are eager to get user feedback, which will be integrated as  soon as possible into the code, with the first enhancements being  released in February. Starting from March, we will be moving to a real  time-based, predictable, transparent and public release schedule, in  accordance with Engineering Steering Committee's goals and users'  requests".


The LibreOffice development roadmap is available at [http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan](http://wiki.documentfoundation.org/ReleasePlan)

If you are a developer and interested in LibreOffice,Â  LibreOffice developers will be meeting at FOSSDEM in Brussels on February 5 and 6 to present their work, and conduct a workshop.

**How to get LibreOffice**

If you are a Ubuntu user, it's easy as adding the PPA:


> **sudo add-apt-repository ppa:libreoffice/ppa**

**sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install libreoffice**


For Windows, OSX and other Linux, users you can directly download it from the LibreOffice website:

I have already downloaded and installed it on my Windows install, and I'll be updating my Arch Linux install soon.

Enjoy!
