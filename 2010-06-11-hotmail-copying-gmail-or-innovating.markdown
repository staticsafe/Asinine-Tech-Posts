Today I got an e-mail from Microsoft with the subject line, "New features coming to Hotmailâ€".

What might these new features be, you might ask?:

**Keep your inbox free  of spam**

The usual anti-spam stuff, nothing special here.

**Sweep away unwanted  email

**Now, this feature is sort of interesting. It is kind of like the "Filter messages like this" option in Gmail, except Sweep will automatically detect your e-mail behavior (moving, deleting etc.) and ask you to do what you did automatically in the feature.

**Send hundreds of  photos without worrying about size limits**

This blew me away. If this actually works, you'll be able to send up to **10GB** of content in one message (each file up to 50 MB)! The content is actually uploaded to another Windows Live service called Skydrive.

Wow! This kills whatever attachment limit Gmail has.

**Smart filters  organize your inbox to find the email that matters**

This filter feature may actually be better than the Filters feature in Gmail.


> Hotmail Quick Views will sort and group email by content or sender  into one list in your inbox. Now items like your Facebook updates, or  your cable TV bills, or just the mail containing photos can be easily  sorted with just a few clicks.


Definitely interested in how this will work.

**View entire email  conversations at a glance**

Now, this is just a plain rip-off off Gmail.


> 
With the new Conversation View, you can automatically group all the  email you have sent and received on a specific topic together in one  view.


Nevertheless, it will be interesting to see how Hotmail implements this feature.

**Respond to social  network notifications without leaving Hotmail**

Hmm...

**Open, view, and edit  documents right in your inbox**

This is a killer feature. With the release of Microsoft Office Web apps, it would be amazing to edit Office files in a native web environment.

Can't wait to test this out.

**Share Microsoft  Office documents online and work together with others**

Collaboration features! This might be the Google docs killer we are looking for.
So what do you think? Is Microsoft copying Google or are they actually innovating this time?

That said, one feature I would really love is free IMAP access.
