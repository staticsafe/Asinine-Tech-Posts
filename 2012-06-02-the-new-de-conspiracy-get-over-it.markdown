So I was reading a [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ugayi/linus_torvalds_on_gnome3_tell_us_what_you_really/) on r/linux, 
and some of the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/ugayi/linus_torvalds_on_gnome3_tell_us_what_you_really/c4vb5il) really pissed me off.

### The Conspiracy


Firstly, what the hell is with the comparison with editors? Guess why vim and emacs are in distro repositories? The reason being that they are actively
developed and maintained. GNOME2 is still being maintained in distros like Debian Squeeze, RHEL and its various clones. With Debian Wheezy, GNOME 3 will
be the new GNOME. This is because the GNOME developers are no longer developing on GNOME2. There is no goddamn conspiracy, the Linux world has simply 
moved on from DEs that are not being actively supported.


### The Circlejerk


But wait, GNOME2 is still being supported with forks like [MATE](http://mate-desktop.org/) and KDE3 is (still!) being supported with [Trinity](http://www.trinitydesktop.org/).
Now the complaint being that these forks are not being supported officially with modern distros. Boo-fucking-hoo. The keyword here being *modern*. A modern distro should focus on 
maintaining DEs that are current and not waste precious maintainer time on (frankly speaking) outdated DEs (I don't agree with Linux Mint supporting MATE either). 


### The Savior

Speaking of KDE3, why would you want to use it anyways? Seriously people, we are not at KDE 4.0 anymore. Am I disagreeing KDE 4's initial release was absolute trash? Nope. But KDE 4.8
has come a long fucking way and is a very polished and completely usable DE (read [this](http://asininetech.com/2012/01/27/why-kde-is-the-future/)).

If you want a GNOME2 alternative that is being actively developed and not about to undergo any drastic changes, why not try [XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/)? It is a feature-complete
and polished DE and some people say the silent competitor. I personally recommend [Xubuntu](http://xubuntu.org/) as the XFCE "distro" of choice.


### Conclusion


My point here being, developers/maintainers are supporting what they are currently developing/maintaining. If you want to use outdated crap, feel free to fork it yourself & maintain
it yourself or use one of the forks. But don't expect $nameofmoderndistro to go supporting/maintaining said fork, because frankly why the hell should they?
