Today, the European commissioner of the digital agenda. Neelie Kroes. expressed her [opinions](http://torrentfreak.com/copyright-is-failing-says-european-commissioner-111121/) about the issues of failing copyright. And she is right. Why should we care about the Intellectual property and copyright? Isn’t it all about the artist getting a compensation for his work? Who stated we need copyright to get this working? Or draconian laws like SOPA and ACTA? Copyright is failing. That’s one thing that is clear. Piracy is only increasing, and the fight against it hasn’t been extremely effective yet. And hopefully never will be. Because for that to be effective. It would mean we would live in a world with a censored Internet.

The next question is: “why does the entertainment industry, and its lawyer groups) want piracy dead?

They don’t. They want control over the medium used to spread piracy. Which, today is the Internet.

**Hunting pirates has become their new business model.**

Why spend billions in creating a new business model that **might** be successful, when you can use your lobby groups to get laws passed that makes you being able to directly profit from piracy?
The entertainment industry doesn’t want piracy dead. It wants it to be alive. Very much alive. This makes it being able for them to keep up the current “status quo”. and being able to profit from it outside traditional business models.

The entertainment industry wants to make itself unmissable. It is stating music will disappear, if they do. this is not true though. there are many artists who are doing new business models to promote their work, like [binärpilot](http://binaerpilot.no/) and [brad sucks.](http://www.bradsucks.net/)

This shows once again, that most of the efforts of the entertainment industry are not to fight piracy but to keep up the status quo.

This was my little rant on piracy (for the day)

_A little bit about myself: My name is Kazen, a 23 year old student from the Netherlands. I usually hang out a lot with the Asinine Tech people. And I’m interested in computers and new issues that arise thanks to digitalization.  This was my first post on Asinine Tech. and I hope you enjoyed it. Also, please don’t burn me to death for any errors as this is my first blog post since the beginning of the Internet :P._
