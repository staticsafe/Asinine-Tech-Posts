Yep. I have disabled comments. Why? Please read [Exhibit A](http://parislemon.com/post/15305835451/bile) and [Exhibit B](http://daringfireball.net/2010/06/whats_fair). Despite my personal dislike for Messieurs Gruber and Siegler, I will agree with them on those points.

Oh, and I disabled in-post ads because they look absolutely horrible.
