Microsoft showed off the new, radical Windows 8 touch UI designed for tablets recently at D9. Unsurprisingly, the company decided to move to a touch centric design following in the footsteps of Apple iOS, Unity in Ubuntu and the new gnome-shell in gnome 3.0.  This transition in UI design is a confusing time for a lot of desktop users. While each of the new GUI choices have their strong points the new Windows 8 touch UI get’s it mostly right (with gnome 3 in a close second place). We’ll take a quick look inside after the break.




### look and feel

Windows 8 at a quick glance can look like an expanded version of Windows Phone 7. Windows 8 uses live tiles in much the same way as Windows Phone 7. These live tiles allow applications to display a wealth of useful information without forcing the user to tap on a notification or open the app. This also allows Windows 8 to be very people and social networking centric, something which the other touch centric desktops have failed to accomplish as of yet.

As shown in the pictures above, the focus is really on full screen apps built with web technologies. Just like the new gnome shell, Windows 8 apps are written using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. This makes the new platform accessible to millions of web developers who might not have been able to develop for mobile computers in the past.


#### But windows no longer has windows


Actually, Microsoft Windows still has “Windows.” You can even run your standard desktop apps such as office along side your new Windows 8 apps (as will be demonstrated in the video at the end). And for users who will prefer the classic desktop experience that option will still be available (something Apple has not done with the iPad).


#### But does it work?


Yes, and here is why. Up until now, the major tech players have been shipping tablets with mobile operating systems. Operating systems that are essentially stripped down to run on a tablet or mobile phone. This doesn’t cut it. I don’t want a 10” smartphone, do you? I’d much rather have a netbook with a full desktop OS. Windows 8 brings this to tablet users. Rather than shipping with a stripped down version of Windows, Microsoft is going to ship a full desktop OS on it’s new line of tablets similar to Ubuntu’s and gnome’s approach. Because of this, we will start to see tablets replace notebooks for most end users who don’t need a laptop but need more functionality than a mobile OS like android or iOS.  Because of this, I believe that the new Windows 8 tablets will sell very well. It will also attract a wide range of web developers which will really help the platform take off.
