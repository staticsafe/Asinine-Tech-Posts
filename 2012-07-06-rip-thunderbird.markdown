I just read the sad [news](http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2012/07/06/thunderbird-stability-and-community-innovation/). 

According to the post:

*"Much of Mozilla’s leadership — including that of the Thunderbird team — has come to the conclusion that on-going **stability** is the most important thing, and that continued innovation in Thunderbird is not a priority for Mozilla’s product efforts.  As a result, the Thunderbird team has developed a plan that provides both stability for Thunderbird’s current state and allows the Thunderbird **community** to **innovate** if it chooses."*

Put down your online petitions people, Thunderbird isn't dying (or dead), Mozilla is just moving focus to Firefox and B2G (their new mobile platform). Since this is an open-source project, I'm sure people who want to maintain and innovate Thunderbird will step up (I'm pretty sure there are a lot of people interested in that!)

The bird isn't dead, its just resting.
