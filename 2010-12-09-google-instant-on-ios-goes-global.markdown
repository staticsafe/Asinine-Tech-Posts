Do you use Google Instant on your computers? Well, it's now fully live on a global basis on iOS device like the iPod Touch, iPhone and the iPad.

Personally, I don't like Google Instant, I disable it on all my computers. For some reason, it just bothers me. Oh, and I like the feeling of pressing enter after a search. It's a oddly satisfying feeling.
