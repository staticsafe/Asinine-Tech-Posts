Strangers can bypass the iPhone OS's lockscreen by performing a series of button presses - hailed as another sign of iOS's weak security measures by critics.

The video link here shows this in action:



[Bug no iOS 4.1](http://vimeo.com/16179929) from [SalomÃ£o Filho](http://vimeo.com/salomao) on [Vimeo](http://vimeo.com).






"...a Brazilian iPhone customer demonstrates the quick method  to circumvent an iPhoneâ€™s passcode-protected lock screen: tap the â€œEmergency  callâ€ button, then three pound signs, and immediately hit the lock button." _Wired_

Once performed, the intruder has complete access to the phone, which may include sensitive data, as well as the Phone app.

Apple has refused to comment on this issue.
