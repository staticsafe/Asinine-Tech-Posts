It's been almost 9 years since IE6 was released, at the time this was the browser to be. And we all know the story so I won't open old wounds, but this is 2010 and Microsoft, say what you will about them, has a winner. That winners name you say? It's name is Internet Explorer 9

(IE9 is sporting a new logo as well, while replacing the Tahoma font for a new more modern Segoe UI)

Read more after the jump!

The chrome of IE9 has been significantly modernized and updated, questionable at some times but still it looks sexy and I mean chrome sexy! Now lets get down to the meat of it, IE9 has a but load of new features but here are the ones you and I care about.



	
  * Full Hardware Acceleration with Dx2D and any hardware that supports Dx9 and above

	
  * Real Time Tab snapping powered by Aero Snap

	
  * Pin To Taskbar Web apps

	
  * An actual download manager!

	
  * And hopefully, with the new UI People will not have a trillion toolbars on their browser

(That's one sexy browser!)


##### DirectX Based Hardware Acceleration?


Let me answer this before we start, it works and it's kick ass! If your hardware can support it you will love it, then again if your on vista or 7 you should have at least DX9 capable hardware. What does this mean you say? It means that things will look smoothing everything will animate sexier, and best of all your CPU won't be taxed up all the time.


##### Tab Snapping?

(The new tab snapping feature in IE9)

It is what it is, or so they say. This is just like dragging tabs in any other browser, expect for that in IE9 it stays at a live preview not a thumbnail.


##### Pinning Web Sites to your Superbar? SHENANIGANS!


[![ie95](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ie95.png)](http://puu.sh/ruI)

(Even Web Sites can use jump lists, so get used to it)

All you do is drag the favicon to your taskbar and boom you have it, the favicon displays next to the back-forward arrows, and they take the color of the favicon. Nothing else really


##### A download manager of some sorts!


[![ie96](http://asininetech.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/ie96.png)](http://puu.sh/ruJ)

(After so many years of imagining, this is what it look likes)

So there it is in all it's glory, but meh it's nothing special cause it's a (drum roll please) Download Manager!!!


##### Conclusion!


Microsoft you have finally redeemed yourself, IE9 is not a turd. Don't listen to the haters it is a well made browser with a lot of potential, and hell who knows, I may even not install Firefox when ever I touch a windows PC. I could have gotten into the Javascript and HTML5 performance but this is something you need to see to believe, so before you judge at least use it and who knows maybe it wouldn't be a bad thing if everyone used this!
