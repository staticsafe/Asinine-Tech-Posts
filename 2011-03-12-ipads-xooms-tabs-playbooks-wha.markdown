I'm really starting to hope that the whole "year of the tablet" thing doesn't end up like the whole "year of the Linux desktop" thing. 2010 only had one good tablet, and that was from apple. Now here we are in 2011, the iPad 2 and Xoom and Galaxy tab are the only tablets available with 2 actually running tablet Os's. The iPad is just a faster iPad, and the Xoom runs software that deserves the "beta" tag but what can you expect from Apple and Google? Now we also have the Playbook coming from RIM, but we have to see how that one works. What i'm trying to get at here is that tablets are a big mess right now for everything. I doubt anyone wants people to see something that looks like a tablet and be like "what type of iPad is that?" That would be bad for developers and Nerds alike. Companies need to work harder to make cheaper price, but better quality tablets or else this will become the PC market. But having Apple as the leader.... yeah we can all see how bad that can get (no apple bashing implied). Google is winning in the mobile market because they can do cheap, quality phones. But now they need to do that to tablets, because I don't care what it has 800$ is way to much for a damn tablet. And also too most programmers will probably stay to iOS if android and whatever OS the playbook runs don't get their act together. Google has too much fragmentation and RIM just can't make software. From my own experience only FOSS programmers wouldn't use iOS because of the "freeness" of it. I really don't want to see tablets go back to "just for group X" like they were when microsoft was the only one who cared about them. Speaking of microsoft they..... nah i've already [ranted on them](http://asininetech.com/2011/01/16/windows8onarm/). So in conclusion, i'm just saying that this is not the way that we should go. We need to make it from companies making cheap tablets that are terrible in quality and run outdated software and only have Apple make anything decent. To Companies and Apple all making cheap tablets that run quality software.
