Now as most of you may know gnome-shell is the next evolution of gnome. It will be the default environment for gnome 3.0 which is scheduled for release in march 2011. As with the transition from KDE 3.5 to KDE 4.0 there are, like always haters, but for gnome shell it seems that the level of hate has been consuming the amount of love for the product. I want to state the reasons why, in my honest opinion gnome shell does not "Sucx Cause we got no choice and it is teh stupid".

#1) Change is a good thing!- Now some change is bad especially if we are moving backwards, but gnome-shell is not. It is just different and people are afraid of trying odd and new things. You are just as good as the windows user who is afraid to try Linux just cause it's not windows. kthnx!

#2)It's a little slow/not as pretty as gnome classic.- Well they still need to make it more visually appealing, so you win this one! >.<

#3) Application A crashes it!-Well that app. "A" is probably chrome or a qt app. (note that qt apps may or may not crash gnome shell, in my experience amarok has) With chrome its the dev's fault cause it doesn't use normal gtk theming.

#4) Who are you? I have never seen you post before!-Well, aah....ummm....errr.Next topic!

Now for the best reason why gnome-shell does not suck!

#5) It's.....not....EFFIN DONE!!!!!- yes you heard it, it is not done. Hence the to be released in march 2011 part! So there is no good reason for you to say something that is not done sucks! kthnx pal!
