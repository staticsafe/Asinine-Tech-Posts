Minecraft for Android is basically classic mode that is free at [http://minecraft.net](http://minecraft.net) . You have a Digital Pad for moving, which is very meh at the moment, but it does do autojump for you. You only have a very limited selection of blocks compared to the desktop version. The levels have lots of fog and you can come into invisible walls very easily. For 7$ this is not worth your money. But knowing the guys at Mojang, it is probably going to get very good over time. I only recommend this to the most hardcore of Minecraft fanboys. You can get it [here](https://market.android.com/details?id=com.mojang.minecraftpe&hl=en) at the Android Market.
