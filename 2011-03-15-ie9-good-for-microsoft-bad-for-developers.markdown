Microsoft has finally announced Internet Explorer 9 at SXSW. Microsoft's new HTML 5 standards compliant browser appears to be a game changer on the surface but underneath that shiny new exterior lies an ulterior motive that threatens to hold back web development significantly.



Microsoft claims that this is the start of a new era, or at least it would like to think so. The new Internet Explorer is standards compliant with the HTML 5 spec. However, as we all know from the past, Microsoft has it's own ideas about what those standards are. Microsoft, like any other for-profit business, has concerns about what standards are adopted and what ones are tossed into the trash. These concerns however threaten to hold back web development much in the same way that Internet Explorer 6 has, and still does.


## The SVG problem all over again


If any of you remember, SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) was introduced as a standard in 1999. Everyone except for Microsoft adopted the new technology. Rather than adopt the new SVG standard, Microsoft decided to create it's own "standard" called VML. Because of this, you, as a developer, couldn't rely on native SVG support. Sure, users could easily download a plugin for Internet Explorer but it wasn't something you could count on. As a result, the new (at that time) SVG format never really became the new cutting edge graphics standard on the web that it should have been. Ever wonder why HTML 5 has two standards for graphics (canvas and SVG)? You can thank Microsoft.


## 11 Years Later


Now, 11 years later, Microsoft has finally adopted native SVG support in it's latest browser. At least that "revolution" can finally begin. There is however, a new elephant in the room and it's name is WebGL.

For those of you who may not know, WebGL is an extension of the OpenGL 3D graphics library. Firefox, Chrome, Opera and Safari all support it. Can you guess which new browser doesn't? If you guessed Internet Explorer 9, you are correct and deserve a cookie! Now, technically WebGL isn't an HTML 5 standard so some might say Microsoft is justified in not supporting it. But, everyone else is and us web developers are eager to start putting out some awesome 3D web applications.


## Slow down pardner


Microsoft however is saying "Whoa! Slow down!" Microsoft simply put doesn't want to support WebGL because it is a direct competitor to it's own DirectX 3D technology. So, are we going to see Microsoft's 3D graphics technology on the web? I'd be willing to bet on it. Once that does happen, we have the SVG/VML issue all over again making IE 9 no different from IE 6. All of this really makes you want to be a web developer doesn't it?

Now, the ability to have 3D graphics in a web browser isn't going to be top priority for the majority of projects but it is a game changing technology that will make Web Applications more powerful in the end. I bet your excited for 3D graphics in your web browser. I am too. Been wanting to play some awesome games on your new CR-48? Me too! If i had one that is. Unfortunately, unless Microsoft throws in WebGL support in it's browser ASAP it's not going to happen for a long, long time. If WebGL support is restricted to only non-Microsoft browsers, we can all say hello to another wasted opportunity (until another 10 years of course, seems to be the pattern for Microsoft).

So, if you really want to, go ahead and download Internet Explorer 9. But, if you want the future to be 3D graphics in your browser, I'd suggest you hop on over to Google, Mozilla, Opera or even Apple's Safari. You'll get a much better browser, and you'll be helping bring awesome 3D graphics to the web sooner.
