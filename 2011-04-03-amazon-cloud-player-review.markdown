Amazon has some balls, with the launch of Cloud Player it's basically telling the record companies to screw off. With that being said, I knew that I had to try out Cloud Player. I thought it was just gonna be some half-assed attempt at adding a media player to drop box, which in essence it is. But was I wrong!



When you first start it up, it asks you to upload some music. If your on windows/osx you have to install an Air app that manages uploading for you. But since I use linux, I had to go into Cloud Drive and manually upload to the music folder. After about a good 7 hours of uploading, my music was ready to play!

Before we get to the player, lets talk alittle bit about Cloud Drive. Cloud Drive is the other service that amazon launched with this. Cloud Drive is basically Dropbox. But you can get up to a terrabyte of storage at costs of 1gb per year. There are music, pictures, documents, and videos folders in Cloud Drive, but music is the only one that gets its own player. And any music you buy from amazon does not add to your storage. And you should buy your music from amazon anyways to be honest.

Here's what the uploading from Cloud Drive looks like:

The Music "application: is very simple. You have a sidebar with columns for Artist, Song, and Albums. Then in the main area it can show images of the artist, album covers, or song titles. The bottom area has very banshee looking media controls. You can also make playlists. Simplistic and something most Linux media players should try and copy . *cough banshee and rhythmbox cough*

At the end of the day, amazon Cloud Player is just not a sign of the future. It is also an actually good service, sure there are other ones, but none of them have a big company like amazon backing them. Which always gives a feeling of safety. The legal battles that come from this are bound to define where the music industry is going in terms of management.
