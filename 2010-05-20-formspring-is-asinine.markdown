[![](http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/6243/formspring1.png)](http://img263.imageshack.us/img263/6243/formspring1.png)Now, I'm a big fan of social networking and blogging/microblogging. Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, last.fm; you name it I'm OK with it. But, I was always uneasy with Formspring.

It seems to have become a major source of cyber-bullying.

Now, before I go on I know cyber-bullying occurs on Facebook, IM chat etc. I'm just trying to point out the faults of Formspring.

You know why?

Read more after the jump..



Why did Formspring become popular? Why do people in the millions flock to a site that only provides basic social networking capability?

I learned something. People like to be asked questions by anonymous people. Why?

People are gluttons for punishment/insults.

**The Power of Anon.**

The ability to remain anonymous on the Internet is very empowering. Now this can be both a good and bad thing. For example, 4chan: a glorious example of the power of anonymity (people call it the cesspool of the Internet, but I beg to differ).

On the other extreme, there is Formspring. In here anonymity brings the worst out in people. The cowardice, anger and hate is evident.

**As a social networking site**

This leads us to the mediocre settings provided by Formspring. There is no way of avoiding anonymous questions. This option does not exist.

Now, you ask, well people can just delete offensive questions. But they still have to **read it. **Imagine coming home and all you see sitting in your inbox is a bunch of very offensive questions. No, not questions but comments. What kind of effect would this have on a person?

**Demographics**

If you are at all familiar with Formspring, you will know that a majority of user demographic consists of young adults (ages 13-19).

Now, as we all know that being a teenager comes packaged with a set of insecurities and the subtle and but always there issue: peer pressure.

Why would a teenager who is already insecure decided to create a Formspring account? Yes, you guessed it: peer pressure.

You ask, why can't they close their Formspring account? Yes, more peer pressure.

More insecurity!

And what happens after a teenager reads all this Formspring questions?

Leading to even more insecurity. And the cycle continues.

And [this](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&ved=0CBcQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nydailynews.com%2Fnews%2Fny_crime%2F2010%2F03%2F25%2F2010-03-25_li_teens_suicide_linked_to_cruel_cyberbullies_police.html&rct=j&q=formspring+suicide&ei=c9D1S6zYPIXGlQex04yKCw&usg=AFQjCNFs0RKM_S8Mc0jQM_ILA5sE8yhpJg) is what it leads to.

Is this what we want? I ask again, why are people (especially teenagers) such a glutton for insults?

Discuss.
