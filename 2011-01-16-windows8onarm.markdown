Well, Microsoft! Oh Microsoft you never learn do you? Recently at CES you announced that Windows 8 will run on ARM SoC processors, but you made it seem like that's what's wrong with the whole windows-on-my-slate-fails issue. When really it's the GUI, even though iOS is just Scaled up for the iPad at least it works. Google is going in the right direction by making 3.0 with a more desktopy feel, but they are staying right at the fine line that makes it a nightmare and easy to use. Even though we will get a ported version of office, it does nothing to help the problem. Sure, sure laptops and netbooks will perform awesomely but the main focus, as said by MS is that it should help get windows on tablets and not suck.

You know, you guys already have 2 other great UI's that would work great on a tablet, why can't you guys just make a mix of Dash (Media Center + Xbox) and Metro (Zune and Windows Phone 7). Maybe take some influence from Aero, but still it's not rocket science. But like always MS misses a cycle, or 2, or 3. To sum this up with a cliche, I'll use one from El Jobs: Details Matter!
