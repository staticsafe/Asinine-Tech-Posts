*jumps around with excitement*

But...

The main page is still offline, and not all blogs are back up at the moment.

According to [TheNextWeb](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2010/12/07/tumblr-back-online-after-24-hours-of-downtime/):


> The company, one that is in top 50 biggest  websites in the U.S., still has yet to confirm what exactly happened but  for a site as big as this to go down for an entire day, they are  obviously dealing with something major.
