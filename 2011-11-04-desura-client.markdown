If you have been paying attention to this blog for the past few days, you probably have heard me mention Desura a time or two or seen it in a screen shot. If you haven't figured out what it is yet, Desura is a content distribution client that mostly specializes in distribution of indie games. This isn't you average run of the mill content distribution service though, what sets it apart is its recently released Linux client. Although there are some pretty good Linux game stores on-line like Gameolith, or tux games, they just don't compare to the solid streamlined experience that Desura offers.Â So what exactly does it have to offer?



To start off, the Desura library is loaded with tons of games to ensure that you won't soon get bored. Games from indie and free open source developers alike. All you have to do is pick what you want and desura will download and install it all for you.

Desura has a ton of features. For instance, right from the library you can choose to launch a game, for some games start a server, or you can go ahead and add the game to your favorites.

Another great aspect of Desura is that most games have the option to try a demo. Since you don't always know whether the game you are going to spend your hard earned cash on will work okay your system, its really convenient to have a demo a few clicks away.

Desura conveniently ties all the info you'd ever want to know about a game into one place. It has a number rating system, a section for news, videos, and pictures for each one of it's entries.

The social side of Desura is very well done; You can join groups, add friends and send messages. It really helps to fill the gap between the gamers and the developers.

Game distribution services are a rare sight on Linux. A client like this will really help to take the fear from developers making games for Linux since they can be assured that everyone has a chance to easily obtain and play their games on Linux. Keep in mind that Desura for Linux is in its early stages so bugs should be expected. Of course it has a mature Windows client For you Windows users out there. You can head over to desura.com for more info or to try it out.
