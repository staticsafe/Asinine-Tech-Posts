For the release of the new movie "Monsters" directed by Gareth Edwards, who also did all of the CGI work, Adobe has partnered with Wired.com to give away a copy of the Adobe Creative Suite 5 Premium Edition, valued at $1,800 USD.

One randomly selected winner will be notified by e-mail. Deadline is 12:01 p.m. Pacific Nov. 1, 2010.
