That above is the new iOS jailbreak released by [comex](http://twitter.com/comex) today. It is a completely independent jailbreak, meaning you don't need to connect it to your computer to perform it. It runs via Safari.




As always, there are a few issues at the moment, some people are reporting that their devices got bricked, some people report FaceTime isn't working, also apparently the jailbreak doesn't work on the iPad. Also MMS stops working for some people.




A FAQ can be found [here](http://claytonbraasch.blogspot.com/2010/08/faq-on-new-jailbreakme-20.html).




I personally don't need this jailbreak as my 2G iPod Touch on iOS 4.0 is already jailbroken via redsnow (a beta version), but people with 3G iPod Touch users should be satisfied now. :)




The jailbreak can be found [here](http://jailbreakme.com).




Good luck and happy jailbreaking!




EDIT 1 - Dev-Team reports most issues have been [fixed](http://blog.iphone-dev.org/post/890709355/the-return-of-jailbreakme-com).
