Man, another post about a thread on [r/linux](http://reddit.com/r/linux)? I should probably stop letting that subreddit rile me up but where else will I get my blog post material?!

Firstly, [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/xcf4n/nonfree_drmd_games_on_gnulinux_good_or_bad_by/) to said thread.

Also, the [RMS post](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonfree-games.en.html) that caused this thread.

## Thoughts on RMS' post

This post is actually rather reasonable. I daresay RMS is getting a bit soft. RMS also poses an interesting question in his post:

>*"Thus, in direct practical terms, this development can do both harm and good. It might encourage GNU/Linux users to install these games, and it might encourage users of the games to replace Windows with GNU/Linux. My guess is that the direct good effect will be bigger than the direct harm. But there is also an indirect effect: what does the use of these games teach people in our community?"*

RMS concedes that these popular non-free programs increase the adoption of Linux. 

To answer his question, I think the indirect effects of said non-free games will have direct effects on the Linux ecosystem. Improving free and non-free drivers being the most significant effect. Though, I cannot foresee any effects that make it positive in the "freedom" dimension as RMS defines [it](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html).

## Commentary on the reddit thread

In this part of the post, I will be quoting some choice comments from the linked reddit post.

[The specimen](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/xcf4n/nonfree_drmd_games_on_gnulinux_good_or_bad_by/c5l682a):

>*"I hate the new breed of GNU/Linux users that simply want it to be an alternative source for proprietary software. They simply don't care about or want freedom as long as they have their games. **They view Stallman as a fanatic** and just want everyone to embrace proprietary software because all the other platforms have it."*

Yes, we **do** view Stallman as a fanatic. But that is fine, every platform has their fanatics, what is your point? intelminer puts it [perfectly](http://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/xcf4n/nonfree_drmd_games_on_gnulinux_good_or_bad_by/c5l6qti):

>*"Some of us are actually pragmatic about the way we use our computers, we don't always use Linux just because its "free" software, we use it because it is an excellent operating system in its own right, and for the tasks at hand is the best solution for the job."*

and..

>*"All that said, if there's a choice between a "free software" and "proprietary" solution to a task at hand, I'd weigh them up on their technical merits rather than ideological ones"*

In short, pragmatism over ideology almost always. I run Windows and Linux on my desktop, am SSHed into multiple Linux servers at all times, have a Macbook Pro running OS X etc. Basically, I don't limit myself to a subset of software just because of some idealistic view on software freedom.

## A fancy heading to end the post

Eh, I hate writing endings to blog posts. Just stay tuned for more commentary on retarded reddit posts.
